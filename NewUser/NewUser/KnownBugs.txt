	Slow preformance between 4pm-6pm

	When multiple users return from "Find User..." button, pressing cancel still fills listbox1 and enables menu.










Fixed: 

	Menu buttons are initially enabled - should be disabled until a user is loaded.
	
		// Fixed added enable_menu() and disable_menu() to Form1 //


	When requesting an email alias default alias is shown as:

		" $firstname . $lastname . @ed.ac.uk "

		The dot after the last name is not intended to be there and messes up the request.

		// Fixed added User.cs line 62 added trim to user object name initialization //
